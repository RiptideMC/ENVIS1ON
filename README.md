# ENVIS1ON
ENVIS1ON is an exploit founded by RiptideMC, aka oof_TOWN_87 or oofTOWN87. It makes it so that you can browse the web without restrictions on a managed device. (School/Work Chromebook) This trick is quite simple and easy to do, unlike other bypasses on managed devices. THIS EXPLOIT ONLY WORKS ON CHROMEBOOKS! Read on for the exploit!

Forenote: ENVIS1ON was tested on a Dell 3110 Chromebook. There might be differences or bugs on others. NOTE: Dell 3120 Chromebooks also work.

First, open Chrome and type in "chrome://chrome-signin". (If you are on Microsoft Edge or not on a Chromebook, it will not work. I will find a way for you users, too.)
It should take you to a "Sign in to add a Google Account" page. Click on the box labeled "Email or phone" and type in "google@d11.org", then click enter.
It might prompt you to do a CAPTCHA test, and this is fine.
Once you have passed this page, it should take you to a school sign-in page. Click on "Sign-in options" at the bottom, then click "Sign in with GitHub".
The page should open up in GitHub. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and click on the tab called "Docs".
Once on this page, scroll all the way to the bottom, then click on "Pricing". (No actual money is involved, don't worry!)
Navigate to the search bar, then type in "GoggleMathGoogle" or "GoggleMath". (Type it exactly like these options shown, with the same letters capitalized and in the same order.)
Click on the GitHub Repository by that name, the one made by RiptideMC, me. (In case someone makes a copy of this repository.)
This page should have links to multiple game sites, proxies, coding websites, and more, and all of them are unblockable. Click one of the links. 
This exploit basically is an unrestricted browser that is inside of "chrome://chrome-signin". You can now access anything on the web. This also does not show in your search history, so if you're on a school or work device that you can't clear your history on, this is very helpful.
Memorize these steps, then do this every time.
