# ENVIS1ON
ENVIS1ON is an exploit founded by RiptideMC, aka oof_TOWN_87 or oofTOWN87. It makes it so that you can browse the web without restrictions on a managed device. (School/work laptop/Chromebook) This trick is quite simple and easy to do, unlike other bypasses on managed devices. Read on for the exploit!
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
First, open Chrome and type in chrome://chrome-signin. (If you are on Microsoft Edge, it might not work. I haven't tested it.)
It should take you to a "Sign in to add a Google Account" page. Click on the box labeled "Email or phone" and type in google@d11.org, then click enter.
It might prompt you to do a CAPTCHA test, and this is fine.
Once you have passed this page, it should take you to a school sign-in page. Click on "more sign-in options" at the bottom, then click "Sign in with GitHub".
The page should open up in GitHub. Scroll all the way to the bottom, and click on the tab called "Docs".
Once on this page, scroll all the way to the bottom, then click on "Pricing". (No actual money is involved, don't worry!)
